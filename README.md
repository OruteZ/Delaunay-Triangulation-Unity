# Delaunay Triangulation Unity Simulation

This project is a Unity simulation for Delaunay Triangulation. It allows users to visualize and interact with the Delaunay Triangulation process.

## Features

- **Camera Control**:
    - Zoom in/out using the mouse wheel.
    - Drag to move the camera.
    - Restrict the camera's movement within a specified range.
- **Vertex Management**:
    - Set the number of vertices using a UI input field.
    - Automatically update the input field with the current number of vertices.
- **Edge Management**:
    - Define and manage edges between vertices.

## Controls

- **Space bar**: Proceed to the next step in the simulation.
- **Enter**: Add the next vertex.
- **R**: Reset the simulation.
- **K**: Toggle the visibility of the edges.
- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in/out.
- **Left mouse button**: Drag to move the camera.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Attach the provided scripts to the appropriate GameObjects in your scene.
4. Configure the camera and UI elements as needed.

## Dependencies

- Unity
